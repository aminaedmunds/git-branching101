# Git Branching

Git branching allows us to make changes and commits to code without affecting the main branch. When you branch off, you create a copy of the code. You can then make the changes you need and commit them to your branch. Once you're happy with the changes, you can then 'merge' them back into the main branch (or the sub-branch that you started from) by making a pull request on git hub.

GitHub pull requests signify the intention to merge in code. In a pull request you can have a conversation about whether the code should be merged in, as well as seeing exactly what files have been changed. Once you merge in the pull request on GitHub, you will need to pull down the updated branches to updated your local repository.

## :bulb: OBJECTIVES FOR THE WORKSHOP

Welcome, budding coder! :seedling: This workshop is all about *git branching and git flow*! Here's a glimpse of what you'll be dabbling in:

- To understand version control and how git works.
- To understand git flow and implement git branching to work collaboratively. 


## :clipboard: GETTING STARTED 

:rocket: Ready for lift-off? Let's set up:

1. `git clone workshop-repo-url`
2. `cd into-your-repo`

And once you've conquered the tasks:

1. Commit your changes with `git commit -m "Workshop Completed!"`
2. Push 'em up with `git push origin your-branch-name`
3. Make a pull request so we can marvel at your genius! :brain: :boom:

## :books: PRE-LEARNING SECTION

Put on your learning cap! :mortar_board: Here are some resources to get you up to speed:

1. **How does git work**: [What is git?](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_branch.asp?remote=github), [How does git work?](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-git/git-checkout.html#checking-out-new-branches-8), [What is a gitflow?](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) 
2. **Git Branching**: [What is git branching](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_branch.asp?remote=github), [Checkout a new branch](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-git/git-checkout.html#checking-out-new-branches-8), [GitHub Git cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) 

Remember, it's a journey, not a race! Take your time, digest the info and ask questions if you're stuck.

## :ticket: TICKETS 

Time to dive into action! :swimmer:‍♂️ Here's what you'll be working on:

### Ticket 1  - Branching off and Merging in!

**Tasks**: 

- Both people in the pair pull down the repo.
- Each make a new branch.
- Decide who is Person 1 and 2, and write a sentence about your favorite moment of SOC so far in `task-1.md`.
- Add and commit your changes to your branch, and push the branch up to GitHub
- On GitHub, create a pull request for each of your branches
- Look through the pull request and see whats changed, leave some comments.
- Merge your pull requests in, one at a time.
- Checkout and pull down the updated main branch.

**HINT**: [Branching and Merging](doc_link)

### Ticket 2 - Dealing with Conflicts!

**Tasks**: 
- Do the same as before, until you have made pull requests, except this time, both change the same lines of code in `task-2.md`.
- This will give you merge conflicts that will need resolving.
- You can do this on GitHub or in vs code.
- Try one way, then repeat the exercise trying the other way.,

**HINT**: [Common merge conflicts and how to solve them!](tutorial_link)

### Ticket 3 - Collaborating with Code!

**Tasks**: 

- Create a web simple page together in `task-3.html`
- Use branching
- Plan what you will work on to avoid conflicts
- Resolve any conflicts that emerge

**HINT**: [Working on a project silmutaneously!](tutorial_link)

And remember, Google is your BFF! Don't be shy to use it! :woman_technologist:

## :warning: COMMON ISSUES 

Uh-oh, run into a wall? :brick: Don't worry, we've all been there! Here are some common issues and their solutions:

### Issue 1: "Fatal Not a Git Repository" Error

**Solution**: Solution 1

### Issue 2:  "Failed to Push Some Refs" Error

**Solution**: Solution 2

### Issue 3: "Branch Already Exists" Error

**Solution**: Solution 3

Remember, it's okay to ask for help. That's how we learn and grow! :sunflower:
